On a romantic date 12,000 kilometers from home, I sat in a hot air balloon wondering how the pilot managed to steer the aircraft. After all, it seemed like the ballon only had controls to go up and down, yet the flight path seemed so intentional. I wanted to understand the dynamics of these balloons, and build a virtual controller capable of maneuvering them.
